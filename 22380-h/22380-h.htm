Transcriber's Note: The short pieces "Suppositious" and "Quite Another Thing" were moved from their original positions accompanying the illustration "The Political Fancy Dress Ball at Covent Gardent" on page 107 to the end of page 108, to prevent the "Essence of Parliament" article from being broken in the middle.

<h2>A BALLAD OF WEALTHY WOOING.</h2>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Ah, why, my Love, receive me</p>
<p class="i2">With such tip-tilted scorn?</p>
<p>Self-love can scarce retrieve me</p>
<p class="i2">From obloquy forlorn;</p>
<p>'Twas not my fault, believe me,</p>
<p class="i2">That wealthy I was born.</p>
<p>Of Nature's gifts invidious</p>
<p class="i2">I'd choose I know not which;</p>
<p>One might as well be hideous</p>
<p class="i2">As shunn'd because he's rich.</p>
<p class="i4">O Love, if thou art bitter,</p>
<p class="i6">Then death must pleasant be;</p>
<p class="i4">I know not which is fitter,</p>
<p class="i6">Not I&mdash;(or is't "not me"?)</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>'Tis not that thou abhorrest,</p>
<p class="i2">Oh, maid of dainty mould!</p>
<p>The foison of the florist,</p>
<p class="i2">The goldsmith's craft of gold;</p>
<p>Nor less than others storest</p>
<p class="i2">Rare pelts by furriers sold;</p>
<p>But knowing I adore thee,</p>
<p class="i2">And deem all graces thine,</p>
<p>My choicest offerings bore</p>
<p class="i2">Just because they are mine.</p>
<p class="i4">Then, smile not, dear deceiver,</p>
<p class="i6">Keep no kind word for me,</p>
<p class="i4">Enough that the receiver</p>
<p class="i6">Is thou&mdash;(or is it "thee"?)</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>When others come, how trimly</p>
<p class="i2">Thou sett'st thy chatty sail!</p>
<p>For me alone all dimly</p>
<p class="i2">Seemeth the sun to fail.</p>
<p>Young <span class="sc">Frank</span> he frowneth grimly,</p>
<p class="i2">And thou turn'st haughty pale.</p>
<p>'Tis not the taint of "City,"</p>
<p class="i2">For here be scores who sport</p>
<p>Their Mayfair manners pretty</p>
<p class="i2">In Cop-the-Needle Court.</p>
<p class="i4">Ah, chill me not so coolly,</p>
<p class="i6">A Cr&oelig;sus though I be&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">The one who loveth truly</p>
<p class="i6">I swear is I&mdash;(or "me"?)</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>But what availeth grammar</p>
<p class="i2">As taught in straitest schools&mdash;</p>
<p>The hammer of the Crammer</p>
<p class="i2">Forging Bellona's tools&mdash;</p>
<p>Or words that humbly stammer</p>
<p class="i2">Regardless of the rules?</p>
<p>And what availeth fretting,</p>
<p class="i2">Deep sighs, and dwindling waist,</p>
<p>And what the sad forgetting</p>
<p class="i2">Of culinary taste,</p>
<p class="i4">Since still thou fondly spurnest</p>
<p class="i6">Five hundred thou. (or "thee."?)</p>
<p class="i4">And on young <span class="sc">Stoney</span> turnest</p>
<p class="i6">Love's eye&mdash;(or <i>is</i> it "me"?)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sad Conclusion</span>.&mdash;To be virtuous for
virtue's sake, without prospect of reward,
this is to be good for nothing!</p>

<p><i>Gladys.</i> "<span class="sc">Listen, Sibyl. Papa has won a Great Moral Victory&mdash;&mdash;What
does a Moral Victory mean exactly</span>?"</p>

<p><i>Sibyl</i> (<i>who has had more experience</i>). "<span class="sc">Oh, it means&mdash;well, that we are to be

<hr />

<h2>INDERWICKEDNESS.</h2>

<p>"I do not wish to make a joke," Mr.
<span class="sc">Inderwick, Q.C.</span>, is reported to have observed
in the course of examining the plaintiff in a
divorce case, but, in spite of this pathetic
announcement, which passed without any
comment from the Judge, the ruling passion
was too strong for him, and he continued,
"but Artists' models are not always models
of virtue, are they?" Not new, not by any
means new, of course, but he had apologised
beforehand, and he couldn't help it; as the
weak heroine, who yields to strong temptation
in a French novel or play, usually
acknowledges "<i>C'&eacute;tait plus fort que moi</i>."
The inflammable materials being in close
contact, there was nothing to 'inder-wick
from catching fire when in proximity to a
spark of genius. Yet so powerfully had the
eminent Queen's Counsel's prefatial apology
affected the court and the audience, that
his saucy sally&mdash;(for there is life in the old
sally yet, whether in our alley or in this
Court)&mdash;was not followed by the usually
reported "laughter." How was it received?
Doubtless with decorous silence and downcast
eyes, expressive of sweet memories of
dear old jokes made long ago, in happier
and brighter times, "when all the world
was young."</p>

<p>When a good old joke is again brought
into Court with or without apology, instead
of its being received with respectful silence,
we should like to read that it was greeted
with "tears" or "sobs." It would, indeed,
not be unbecoming on the part of the Judge
if, unable to control his emotion, he had
immediately arisen, and, in broken judicial
utterances, had adjourned the Court for the
day, out of respect to the memory (for old
jokes) of the Leader or Junior who had
apologetically perpetrated one. Should Mr.
<span class="sc">Inderwick</span> try this again,
the new effect, as above
suggested, may be obtained
to the satisfaction
of all parties, except,
maybe, those to the suit,
"whom," as one learned
brother might say with
another, and still profounder
apology, "such
a proceeding would not
<i>suit</i> at all."</p>

<h2>LINES ON A LIFE-BELT.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>After Waller's "On a
Girdle.</i>")</p>

<blockquote><p>["According to the evidence
of the only two witnesses
who sailed with her, no
Life-belts were forthcoming,
when the Life-belts might
have given many of those on
board a last chance of life."&mdash;<i>The

<p>And hope of life, I cannot find.</p>
<p>No monarch but would give his crown</p>
<p>For a Life-belt, when ships go down.</p>

<p>A certain noble Lord
was supposed to have
somewhat disparaged
one of his horses on
sale by describing him as "a Whistler."
<span class="sc">James McNeill</span>, "of that ilk," was of
opinion that this description, supposing the
animal to have been "a genuine Whistler,"
ought to have increased its value considerably.</p>

<p>There was a feeling of uncertainty in the
House of Commons last Wednesday, as to what
should be taken to constitute "A Religious
Body." Not to go harking back to the Rev.
<span class="sc">Sydney Smith's</span> definition of "a Corporation"&mdash;which,
without speaking it profanely,
cannot be here quoted without offending eyes
polite,&mdash;one may say that "A Religious Body"
is a contradiction in terms. It is simply "A
Soul-less Thing."</p>

<hr />

<p>"What's the name of that German Beer?"
asked Mrs. R., "I rather think it is Pil-sen-ner.
It sounds to me more like medicine."</p>

<h2>THE MAN FROM BLANKLEYS.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">A Story in Scenes</span>.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="sc">Scene XI.</span>&mdash;<i>The Drawing-room.</i> Mrs. <span class="sc">Gilwattle</span> <i>is still unable to
express her feelings by more than a contemptuous glare.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Uncle Gabriel.</i> My&mdash;ah&mdash;love, you didn't hear me. I was saying
I've almost prevailed on his Lordship&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gilwattle</i> (<i>becoming articulate</i>). His Lordship, indeed! If
<i>that's</i> a Lord, I don't wonder you're such a Radical!</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> Why&mdash;why&mdash;what's <i>come</i> to you, <span class="sc">Joanna</span>? My
Lord, I hope you'll excuse her&mdash;she's a little&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gil.</i> Fiddlesticks! You've been made a fool of, <span class="sc">Gabriel</span>!
Can't you see for yourself
that he's neither the manners
nor yet the appearance of a
<i>real</i> nobleman&mdash;or anything
but what he <i>is</i>?</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> (<i>dropping</i> Lord
S.'s <i>arm</i>). Eh? If you're not
a Lord, Sir, what else <i>are</i> you?</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>wavering
between wrath and amusement</i>).
Afraid I can't enlighten
you&mdash;I'm extremely
curious to know myself.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>distractedly</i>). Oh,
Aunt, it wasn't my fault,
really! <span class="sc">Montague</span> <i>would</i>
have him! And&mdash;and we <i>sent</i>
round to say he wouldn't be
required&mdash;we did indeed!
Please, <i>please</i> don't tell anybody!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Gil.</i> (<i>rigidly</i>). It is
my <i>duty</i> to let everyone here
know how disgracefully we
have been insulted to-night,
<span class="sc">Maria</span>, and might have gone
away in ignorance, but for
that innocent child&mdash;who has
done nothing, that <i>I</i> can see,
to deserve being shaken like
that! <i>I</i>'m not going to sit
by in silence and see a man
passed off as a Lord who is
nothing more nor less than one
of the assistants out of <span class="sc">Blankley's</span>
shop, hired to come and
fill a vacant seat! Yes, <span class="sc">Gabriel</span>,
if you doubt my word,
look at <span class="sc">Maria</span>&mdash;and <i>now</i> ask
that young man to dine!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Profound sensation among
the company.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> I&mdash;ah&mdash;withdraw
the invitation, of course&mdash;it
is cancelled, Sir, cancelled!</p>

<p><i>Feminine Murmur.</i> I had a
feeling, the moment he came
in, as if&mdash;so thankful now I
didn't commit myself by so
much as&mdash;ah, my dear, it all
comes from a desire to make a
show!&mdash;&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> It's the bare-faced
impudence of coming
here on false pretences, that
<i>I</i> can't get over. Come, Mr. <span class="sc">Shopwalker, Counterjumper</span>, or
whatever you really are, what have <i>you</i> got to say for yourself?</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> Say? Why&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>He struggles to control his countenance for a moment, until he
is convulsed at last by irrepressible laughter.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>All</i> (<i>except the</i> <span class="sc">Tidmarshes</span>). He's laughing&mdash;positively <i>laughing</i>
at Us! The brazenness of it!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>regaining composure</i>). I&mdash;I'm awfully sorry, but it
struck me suddenly as so&mdash;&mdash;After all, the joke is only against
myself. (<i>To himself.</i>) Must try and get my unfortunate hostess
out of this fix&mdash;not that she deserves it! (<i>Aloud.</i>) If you will
kindly let me explain, I think I can&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tid.</i> (<i>suddenly</i>). Oh, hang explaining! It's all out now, and
you'd better leave it there!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> I can't, indeed. I must make you all understand
that this well-meaning lady with the highly-developed sense of duty
has done our host and hostess a grave injustice, besides paying me a
compliment I don't deserve. I'm sorry to say I can't claim to be
half as useful a member of the community as any of the very obliging
and attentive gentlemen in Mr. <span class="sc">Blankley's</span> employment. If I'm
anything, I'm a&mdash;an Egyptologist, in an amateur sort of way, you
know. A&mdash;in fact, I'm writing a book on Ancient Egypt.</p>

<p><i>The Others.</i> A <i>literary</i> man! As if <i>that</i> made it any better!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> I merely mention it because it led me to write to
Mr. <span class="sc">Cartouche</span>&mdash;whom I happened to hear of as a famous
collector&mdash;and ask to be allowed to call and inspect his collection.
Mr. <span class="sc">Cartouche</span> (who lives, I believe, at No. 92, next door) very
kindly wrote, giving me leave, and inviting me to dine at the same
time, and&mdash;I know it was unpardonably careless of me&mdash;but somehow
I came here instead, and, Mr. and Mrs. <span class="sc">Tidmarsh</span> being both
too&mdash;er&mdash;hospitable to undeceive
me, I never found my
mistake out till too late to put
it right, without inconveniencing
everybody. That's
really all.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Uneasy reaction in the
company.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> (<i>pompously</i>).
Ha&mdash;hum&mdash;no doubt that
puts a somewhat different
complexion on the case, but
it doesn't explain your conduct
in calling yourself Lord
<span class="sc">Strathfoozleum</span>, or whatever
it was.</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> I think you
mean <span class="sc">Strathsporran</span>. I did
call myself that, because it
happens to be my name.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>passionately</i>). I
don't believe it.... I <i>can't</i>.
If it is, why did Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span>
call you "Mr. <span class="sc">Claypole</span>"?</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> I beg your
pardon&mdash;<span class="sc">Claymore</span>. Because,
when we last met, I was
<span class="sc">Douglas Claymore</span>, with no
prospect whatever, as it
seemed then, of being anything
else.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>faintly</i>). Then
he really is&mdash;<i>Oh</i>!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>She sinks on the couch,
crushed.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Uncle Gab.</i> Ha, well, my
Lord, I'm glad this little
misunderstanding is so satisfactorily
cleared up, and if I
may venture to hope for the
honour of your company,&mdash;shall
we say Friday wee&mdash;&mdash;(Lord
S. <i>looks at him steadily.</i>)
Oh, if your Lordship has some
better engagement, well and
good. Makes no difference
to <i>me</i> I assure you. <span class="sc">Joanna</span>,
our carriage must be here by
now, say good-bye and have
done with it! Good-night,
<span class="sc">Maria</span>, I'll see you don't
expose me to <i>this</i> again!</p>

<br />

<blockquote><p><span class="sc">Scene XII.</span>&mdash;<i>The guests have
all taken leave with extremely
frosty farewells</i>;
Mr. <span class="sc">Tidmarsh</span> <i>is downstairs superintending their departure.</i>
<span class="sc">Gwennie</span> <i>has been pardoned on</i> Lord S.'s <i>intercession, and
dismissed, in much bewilderment, to bed.</i> Mrs. <span class="sc">Tidmarsh</span> <i>and</i>
Lord <span class="sc">Strathsporran</span> <i>are alone.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> (<i>hysterically</i>). Oh, Lord <span class="sc">Strathsporran</span>, when I think
how I&mdash;&mdash;What can I <i>ever</i> say to you?</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> Only, I hope, that you forgive my stupidity in
blundering in here as I did, Mrs. <span class="sc">Tidmarsh</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> It <i>was</i> a good deal your fault. If you had only said
who you really were&mdash;if my husband had not been idiot enough to
misunderstand&mdash;if Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span> had been more straightforward, all
this would never&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/099.png"><img width="100%" src="images/099.png" alt="" /></a><h3>"Sitting down heavily on a Settee."</h3></div>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> We were all the victims of circumstances, weren't
we? But I, at least, have no reason to regret it. And, if I may ask
one last indulgence, will you&mdash;a&mdash;let me have an opportunity of
saying good-bye to Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span>?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Tid.</i> She, she doesn't <i>deserve</i>&mdash;Oh, I don't know <i>what</i> I'm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span>saying. Of <i>course</i>, Lord <span class="sc">Strathsporran</span>, anything, <i>anything</i> I can
do to&mdash;&mdash;I will send her down to you, if you will only wait. She
shall not keep you long!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> (<i>alone, to himself</i>). It's an ill wind, &amp;c. I shall
have <span class="sc">Marjory</span> all to myself, now! To think that&mdash;but for a lucky
blunder&mdash;I should be spelling out scarabs and things on the wrong side
of that wall at this moment, and never dreaming that <span class="sc">Marjory</span> was
so&mdash;&mdash;Ah, she's coming! (Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span> <i>enters, looking pale and disconsolate.</i>)
<span class="sc">Marjory</span>, you've no idea what you've missed! I <i>must</i>
tell you&mdash;it's too good to lose. What <i>do</i> you think all these good
people have been taking me for? You'll never guess! They
actually believed I was hired from <span class="sc">Blankley's</span>! Give you my word
they did!... Why don't you <i>laugh</i>, <span class="sc">Marjory</span>?</p>

<p><i>Miss Seaton</i> (<i>faintly</i>). I&mdash;I <i>am</i> laughing. No, <span class="sc">Douglas</span>, I'm
not. I can't; I haven't the conscience to. Oh, I never meant you
to know&mdash;but I must tell you, whatever comes of it! <i>I</i> believed it
too, at first. (<i>Tragically.</i>) I <i>did</i>, <span class="sc">Douglas</span>!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> <i>Did</i> you though, <span class="sc">Marjory</span>? Then, by Jove, I <i>must</i>
have looked the character!</p>

<p><i>Miss Seaton</i> (<i>timidly</i>). I knew you&mdash;you weren't very well off,
<span class="sc">Douglas</span>, and so I fancied you might&mdash;&mdash;Oh, I know it was hateful
of me ever to think such a thing, but I did. And you can never
<i>really</i> forgive me!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> Couldn't think of it! Shall I tell you something
else, <span class="sc">Marjory</span>? I've a strong impression that you will not be an
inmate of this happy English household <i>much</i> longer.</p>

<p><i>Miss Seaton.</i> I'm <i>sure</i> I shan't, from Mrs. <span class="sc">Tidmarsh's</span> expression
just now. But I don't care!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> Don't be reckless. How do you know there isn't a
moral lion about? And where will you go next, <span class="sc">Marjory</span>?</p>

<p><i>Miss Seaton</i> (<i>with a shrug</i>). I don't know. I suppose to anybody
who wants a Governess, and doesn't mind taking her without a
reference, if there <i>is</i> such a person!</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> Well, oddly enough, I fancy I know somebody who
has been trying for a long time to find a young person of just your
age and appearance, and might be induced to waive a reference on a
personal interview. (Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span> <i>looks incredulous.</i>)... <span class="sc">Marjory</span>,
don't you understand? If I hadn't been such a pauper, I'd have
spoken long ago, when we were up in Scotland together, only it didn't
seem fair then. I&mdash;I daresay I've no better chance now; but, at
least, I've more right to speak than I had, and&mdash;and&mdash;will you have
me, <span class="sc">Marjory</span>? (<i>She turns away.</i>) I&mdash;I won't worry you, dear, if
you really can't care about me in that way; but&mdash;but if you only
<i>could</i>, <span class="sc">Marjory</span>, even a little!</p>

<p><i>Miss Seaton.</i> <span class="sc">Douglas</span>!...</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Same Scene&mdash;somewhat later.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> Not yet, <span class="sc">Marjory</span>&mdash;I can't let you go just yet!...
Must I, really? Before I've said half what I wanted!... Well&mdash;in
one minute, then. And you're coming to my people as soon as
you can get out of this, <span class="sc">Marjory</span>; and I shall see you every day,
till&mdash;till we shall never be separated any&mdash;&mdash;Confound it!&mdash;who's
that? [Mr. <span class="sc">Tidmarsh</span> <i>enters suddenly.</i></p>

<h2>HARE-ING HIS DIPLOMACY.</h2>

<p>As I have already conveyed, in a short note last week, the first
night of the revival of <i>Diplomacy</i>, viz., Saturday, Feb. 18th, will
be for ever memorable in the annals of the English stage in general,
and in the reminiscences of Mr. <span class="sc">John Hare</span> in particular, whenever
he may choose to
give them to the
public, It will also
afford matter for a
brilliant chapter
in the second or
third series of Mr.
and Mrs. <span class="sc">Bancroft's</span>
<i>On and
Off the Stage</i>.
A great night, too,
for the eminent
adapters Messrs.
<span class="sc">Scott</span> and <span class="sc">Stephenson</span>,
once
known as "the
Brothers <span class="sc">Rowe</span>,"
who rowed in the
same boat.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:55%;"><a href="images/100.png"><img width="100%" src="images/100.png" alt="" /></a><h3>"Three Men in a boat."</h3></div>

<p>Never, at any
time, has this version
of the French
play been so well
cast as it is now at
Garrick Theatre,
though nervousness
told on
all the actors,
especially on the
elder ones, except,
apparently, Mrs. <span class="sc">Bancroft</span>, in whose performance there was hardly
any trace of it, though once she nearly missed her cue while resting
awhile at the back of the stage.</p>

<p>The part of <i>Lady Henry Fairfax</i> has literally nothing whatever
to do with the plot, and were it not played as it is now, and played
so capitally by Mrs. <span class="sc">Bancroft</span>, it would be better, for an English
audience at least, if omitted entirely, or reduced to a few appropriate
lines in pleasant places. An English audience wants the
story, when once begun, to go on without any break or interruption;
and indeed, but for dramatic effect, an English audience is inclined
to resent even the division of a piece into Acts, unless such arrangement
is evidently necessitated by some heavy mechanical change of
scenery.</p>

<p>So our audiences would decidedly prefer to have the <i>r&ocirc;les</i> of <i>Lady
Henry</i> and <i>The Marquise de Rio Zar&egrave;s</i> (with her wearisome iteration
about "Don <span class="sc">Alva</span>," and played with rather too much accentuation
by Lady <span class="sc">Monckton</span>) reduced to the smallest possible
algebraic expression. Mr. <span class="sc">Bancroft</span> was the same <i>Count Orloff</i> as
he was years ago on the little stage of the old Prince of Wales's
Theatre; his action more deliberate than when he was younger and
more impetuous;
his pauses for
meditation longer
by a thought or
so than of yore;
while in his tone
and manner there
was just a
delicately-deepened
colouring of the
genuine original
Bancroftian "Old
Master." To Mr.
<span class="sc">Bancroft</span>, resuscitating
our old
courtly friend
<i>Count Orloff</i> (now
<i>Count Orl-on-again</i>),
I would
address the once
well-known line
from "<i>Woodman,
spare that
Tree</i>"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Touch not a single <i>bow</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="sc">Arthur Cecil</span>,
too, as <i>Baron
Stein</i>, excellent,
<i>cela va sans dire</i>; yet, somehow, his effects now seem to me to be
laid on with too broad a brush, especially in the scene of his last
appearance, where he makes a sly, and, for the <i>Baron Stein</i>, a rather
over-elaborated and farcical attempt to recapture the letter he has
just given up. <span class="sc">Forbes Robertson</span> is good from first to last as the
very weak-knee'd <i>Julian Beauelere</i>, sufficiently emotional in the
strong situations, and never better than when the character itself
is at its weakest; that is, in the one great scene with his wife.</p>

<p>The <i>Algie Fairfax</i>, of Mr. <span class="sc">Gilbert Hare</span>, was natural
where the authors have allowed him to be natural, and best,
therefore, in the last Act, where he has become a responsible
personage in a diplomatic office. The "three-men-in-a-difficulty"
scene went as well as ever, though, on the whole, played far too
slowly, and with so much "suppressed force," that the celebrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span>"<i>Monsieur! &agrave; vos ordres!</i>" when <i>Orloff</i> suddenly breaks out into
"the language of diplomacy," did not electrify the house. On the
contrary, the audience took it very quietly, awaiting with some
curiosity the interference of <i>Henry Beauclerc</i>. And it was at this
point that the services of Mr. <span class="sc">John Hare</span> in this character were
invaluable. Never had his crisp incisive style produced more marked
effect. It is a pity that in the Third Act, which being the weak point
of the play requires all the strength of the actor to be seriously
employed, Mr. <span class="sc">Hare</span> should have given a very light comedy, nay,
even a farcical touch to his treatment of the "business" of sniffing
the perfume&mdash;when he is literally "on the scent"&mdash;and to the
momentous situation of his interview with <i>Zicka</i>. "<i>Maintenant &agrave; nos deux!</i>" Odd that, in his treatment of the strength of the scent,
<span class="sc">Sardou</span> should have shown the feebleness of his methods. Yet so it is.
The play, at this point, being practically played out, he carelessly
chucks the puppets into a
corner. He has made his
great scenes, and there's an
end of it; let the weakest
go to the wall.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:42%;"><a href="images/101a.png"><img width="100%" src="images/101a.png" alt="" /></a><h3><span class="sc">Duet</span>&mdash;<i>Baron Cecil Stein and Lady Henry Bancroft Fairfax</i> (<i>with original
model of Strasbourg Clock</i>)&mdash;"Here we are again!"</h3></div>

<div class="figright" style="width:27%;"><a href="images/101b.png"><img width="100%" src="images/101b.png" alt="" /></a>
<h3><span class="sc">Scent Zicka</span>&mdash;from a (guilt)-stained-glass
Russian window.</h3></div>

<p>Last of all to be mentioned
with unstinted praise is
Miss <span class="sc">Kate Rorke</span>. It is as
well to remember throughout
that we are witnessing
a play of semi-French, not
purely domestic English life,
and the essence of the play
could not be adapted to
ordinary English notions.
<i>Julian Beauclerc</i>, for example,
in England, would
never have challenged <i>Count
Orloff</i>; he might have had
"a deuce of a row with
him"; <i>et voil&agrave; tout</i>. <i>Dora</i>,
as a young Irish girl, and
not, as she is here, a half-breed,
would never have
threatened to suicide herself
out of the window, though
all else she, as a not particularly
well-educated, but
certainly very impulsive
girl, might probably have
done. Her great scene,
where she bangs her fists
against the looked doors,
shrieking to her husband to
return&mdash;an effect to be led
up to and made within the
space of a minute&mdash;was, if I
may be allowed to say so,
without being suspected of
exaggeration, "just perfect."
That some considerable
time will elapse before
the enthusiasm aroused by this revival dies out among the patrons
and lovers of the Drama-at-its-best is the private opinion, publicly
expressed, of Yours, truly, <span class="sc">"The One Man Seen" in a Box</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;When <i>Diplomacy</i> shall have accomplished its Hundred
Nights, Mr. <span class="sc">Hare</span> can announce its Scentenary.</p>

<p><span class="sc">An Orleans Plum</span>.&mdash;Prince <span class="sc">Henri d'Orl&eacute;ans</span> (says the <i>Times</i>) has just been
rebuking the British people for the Chauvinism of their Oriental policy. Like
the late <span class="sc">M. Massie</span>, whose shade he invokes, the young Prince seems to object
to us, not because we commit any specific acts of hostility, but "because we
look on in a most aggravating fashion." This is truly funny! One country may
steal a&mdash;Tonkin, but another may not look over a boundary! Prince <span class="sc">Henry</span>
presents a peculiarly close parallel to <span class="sc">Keene's</span> infuriated (and incoherent)
Paterfamilias, who angrily commanded his silent son "not to look at him in <i>that</i>
tone of voice!"</p>

successfully at the Theatre at Monte Carlo. According to some stern moralists,
who regard the Principality as a gambling-hell upon earth, this particular Opera
was in a quite congenial atmosphere. Odd that in the two Principalities, Monte
Carlo and Wales, the objects for Disestablishment should be so diametrically
opposite. In Wales it is the particular Church, and at Monte Carlo it is the not-at-all-particular
t'other word, unmentionable twice in the same paragraph to
ears polite.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="center">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, February 20.</i>&mdash;New
Chairman to-day; dropped in in most casual way.
Wondered to see <span class="sc">Mellor</span> wandering about Library and
corridors at three o'clock in afternoon in full evening
dress. "Going out to tea?" I asked, in my genial
way.</p>

<p>"Order! order!" said <span class="sc">Mellor</span>; "the Hon. Member
will please give notice of that question." And he
stalked off, trying to convey to the mind of his astonished
interlocutor as near an approach to back view
of <span class="sc">Courtney</span> as could be attained, without loan of late
Chairman's famous summer pantaloons.</p>

<p>Everything explained later. Soon as questions over,
Mr. G., rising and fixing glittering eye on <span class="sc">Speaker</span>,
observed, "I beg to move that you, Sir, do now leave
the Chair." Strangers in Gallery pricked up their
ears; thought <span class="sc">Speaker</span> been doing something, and was
now in for it. Right Hon. Gentleman offered no
defence, but meekly left Chair. Mr. G. up again like
a shot. "I beg to move that Mr. <span class="sc">Mellor</span> do take
the Chair," he said. Then <span class="sc">Mellor</span> (fortuitously on
spot in evening dress) stepped into Chair, where through
six Sessions, <span class="sc">Courtney</span> has sat ruling the whirlwind out
of order, and riding on the storm. All done in moment.
Before you knew where you were, there was new
Chairman of Committees proposing vote of £2,000 for
rearrangement of rooms in Houses of Parliament.
<span class="sc">Alpheus Cleophas</span> rose, with evident intent of
wanting to know "about these rooms," when irrepressible
Mr. G. on his feet again. "I beg to move," he
said, addressing Chairman, "that you do report progress,
and ask leave to sit again."</p>

<p>Rather hard this on <span class="sc">Mellor</span>. Just got into Chair;
beginning to feel comfortable. Had proposed subject
that might have agreeably occupied Committee for half
an hour, when here comes the untameable, irresistible,
peremptory Mr. G., and bundles him off. At first some
signs of inclination to resist. New Chairman, having
put question and declared it carried, should forthwith
have stepped away from the table. <span class="sc">Mellor</span> dropped
into Chair again.</p>

<p>A moment of embarrassment. <span class="sc">Courtney</span>, looking
critically on form below Gangway, grimly smiled.
Members under Gallery tittered. Clerk nudged new
Chairman in ribs. <span class="sc">Mellor</span> sat on till, lifting his eyes,
discovered Mr. G. meaningly regarding him. Knew
he'd be up again if he didn't go; so with promising
alacrity, hopped out of Chair, and disappeared from
ken of House.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," said honest <span class="sc">Bill Cremer</span>.
"Of course I don't hold with <span class="sc">Courtney's</span> goings-on
in the political field, and he can scarcely have expected
us to keep him on in a snug berth. But this I will say,
the manners of the new Chairman may, so to speak,
be more <span class="sc">Mellor</span>, but, as Chairman of Committees,
<span class="sc">Courtney</span>'ll be hard to beat."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;"Ban, ban, Caliban, got a new
Premier, get a new man"&mdash;in Chairman of Committees.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;"The life of Her Majesty's Ministers,"
said the <span class="sc">Grand Young Gardner</span>, moodily contemplating
his spats, "is not an entirely happy one. I
think I may add that is peculiarly the case with the
<span class="sc">Minister</span> for <span class="sc">Agriculture</span>. I must say, if the
language, be not regarded as too flowery&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The <span class="sc">Minister</span> for <span class="sc">Agriculture</span>," I said, desiring
to put <span class="sc">Gardner</span> at his ease, "would be fully
justified in using cauliflowery language."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Then I'll say I go to bed with
tuberculosis, and get up with <span class="sc">Harry Chaplin</span>. The
casual observer is, doubtless, aware that <span class="sc">Chaplin</span> has
an eye. He sees it gleaming through the eyeglass.
I feel it ever upon me. It is no slight thing to have
succeeded a statesman of the calibre of <span class="sc">Chaplin</span>. But
when he persistently sits opposite you, critically observing
all your movements with that air of supreme
intelligence which more than hints that, as <span class="sc">Minister</span>
for <span class="sc">Agriculture</span>, he was personally acquainted with
every one of the cattle on a thousand hills, it is an ordeal
that calls into play all the higher faculties of Man. As
to the tuberculosis, it is always breaking out in unexpected
places; people concerned insist upon regarding
me as personally responsible for the visitation."</p>

<p>"But," I said, "you have your little holiday, Saturday to
Monday, and get out to dinner on off-nights?"</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span><p>"No," he sighed, "the <span class="sc">Minister</span> for <span class="sc">Agriculture</span> has no off-nights;
and if I go to church at the seaside on a Sunday, the Church-warden
in passing round the collection-plate,
is sure to steal into my hand a
telegram, announcing a fresh outbreak
of tuberculosis. As to going out to
dinner&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/108a.png"><img width="100%" src="images/108a.png" alt="" /></a><h3>Harry'd H-rry Ch-pl-n, as he appeared when
meditating on Bimetallistic and Agricultural
Distress.</h3></div>

<p>"Ministers," <span class="sc">Causton</span> here observed,
"never dine out when the House is sitting,
unless commanded by the <span class="sc">Queen</span>,
and Whips can't be spared even to dine
with <span class="sc">Her Majesty</span>."</p>

<p>"As to going out to
dinner," continued the
<span class="sc">Grand Young Gardner</span>,
ignoring the interruption
of his genial
colleague, "it is impossible.
It was said,
I believe by one of
themselves, 'The
Guard dies, but never
surrenders.' I may
add, the <span class="sc">Minister</span> for
<span class="sc">Agriculture</span> lunches
but never dines. What
would become of the
Government if a division-bell
rang and he
was found out of the
way? Now to-night,
you would say, looking
at the business, I
might well be spared. We commence with <span class="sc">Kimber</span> on disparities
in the representation of constituencies. <span class="sc">Rollit</span> will follow in the
interests of undersized flat-fish. What has the <span class="sc">Minister</span> for <span class="sc">Agriculture</span>
to do with flat-fish of whatever size? you might ask. To
the casual observer, nothing.
But, looking ahead, as the
responsibilities of my position
make it necessary I
should habitually do, I recall
the fact that sometimes
the placid pilchard is cast
upon our shores in such
quantities as to be carted
away for manurial purposes.
I am not intimately acquainted
with the pilchard.
It is not like the terrapin a
land fish. I am not sure it
is flat. Still I have a strong
impression it is undersized.
Therefore it might come
within the purview of the
discussion on <span class="sc">Rollit's</span> motion.
<span class="sc">Mundella</span>, as you
say, is in charge of the debate,
and I might comfortably
go to dinner. But what
does <span class="sc">Mundella</span> know of
manure? No; the <span class="sc">Minister</span>
for <span class="sc">Agriculture</span> remains,
and will dine,&mdash;if necessary
die, at his post."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;8:10 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>,
House Counted Out, whilst
<span class="sc">Grand Young Gardner</span> is
explaining how it was he
couldn't go out to dinner.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/108b.png"><img width="100%" src="images/108b.png" alt="" /></a><h3>"THE WESTMINSTER PLAY."</h3>

<p><i>Young Grandolphus</i> (<i>in costume, with appropriate action</i>). "H&aelig;c recinunt Juvenes
dictata senesque!"</p></div>

<p><i>Friday</i>, 12:30 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>&mdash;Storm
subsided. Magnificent whilst
it lasted. <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> in fine
form. Mr. G., under his
influence, renewed his youth
like the eagle. At same
time, though Welsh Church
may be doomed, supply of
cabs on night like this inadequate.
Better be put in yard in good time. <span class="sc">Kenyon</span> lingers on scene,
still asking for Bill to be "taken <i>de die in diem</i>." "As if he were
giving a prescription," said <span class="sc">Wilfrid Lawson</span>, back from Mansion
House, where he has seen his portrait presented to Lady <span class="sc">Lawson</span>.
<span class="sc">Kenyon</span>, with eye on Bishop of <span class="sc">St. Asaph</span>, up in Peers' Gallery,
made desperate resistance to attack on Church. Bishop looked a
little grave when <span class="sc">Kenyon</span> dropped into metaphor.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:25%;"><a href="images/108c.png"><img width="100%" src="images/108c.png" alt="" /></a><h3><span class="sc">A Feature of the Debate</span>.</h3>

<p><i>M-nd-lla.</i> &Agrave; cause de mon nom
suis-je "alien"?</p>

<p><i>J. L-wth-r</i> (<i>heard but not seen</i>).
Non, Monsieur! Mais vous <i>n'osez</i>
pas dire le contraire.</p></div>

<p>"Bill like bagged fox, don't you know," said <span class="sc">Kenyon</span>, nodding
confidentially to <span class="sc">Speaker</span>. "Meant to run any way you like.
What I mean to say is&mdash;" and
here he turned for approval to
Lord Bishop, consorting in Gallery
with his fighting Dean, "this
fox is so tainted with insincerity,
or aniseed, that the hounds may
just as well shut up their noses,
and have nothing to do with it."</p>

<p>With this sage remark, and,
something horribly like a wink at
the Bishop, <span class="sc">Kenyon</span> sat down.
Up again later, when Closure
moved. <span class="sc">Hicks-Beach</span>, in temporary
command of Opposition,
deprecated resistance. But <span class="sc">Kenyon's</span>
blood up. With strong
effort of self-restraint he stopped
himself midway in stentorian
shout, "Yoicks!" dexterously
turned the "Yo" into "No," and
so saved himself from reproof of
<span class="sc">Speaker</span>. Having got the "No!"
he made most of it. Nothing left
but to clear House for Division.
Members near entreated <span class="sc">Kenyon</span>
to desist from further opposition.
No use fighting Closure; only
meant another Division and twenty
minutes' prolongation of sitting.
<span class="sc">Kenyon</span>, with eye reverently fixed
on Bishop, immovable. Others
might falter on the way; might
palter with the truth; might
parlay with the enemy. <span class="sc">Kenyon</span>
would have no compromise, no surrender. "Yoic&mdash;&mdash;" he meant
"No! no!" and he shouted
it too.</p>

<p>"Will the Hon. Member
name another teller?" said
the wary <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, when
House cleared for Division.
<span class="sc">Kenyon</span>, evidently still
seeing the fox steal away,
Aniseed at the Helm and
Insincerity at the Prow,
almost stumbled on the name
"<span class="sc">Yoicks!</span>" Again stopped
himself just in time, and
looked forlornly round; eye
finally resting on Peers' Gallery.
If only the Bishop
could "tell" with him!
That evidently out of order.
Bishop belonged, to other
House. No one volunteering
to stand with him in the
breach, and two tellers being
a necessary preliminary to
Division, <span class="sc">Kenyon</span> bent his
head in silent grief, and
leave given to bring in Bill
which <span class="sc">Asquith</span> remorselessly
admitted was first step
towards Disestablishment of
Welsh Church.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Welsh
Church Suspensory Bill read
First Time, by majority of
56, in excited House of 546
Members.</p>

<p><i>Friday Night.</i>&mdash;After the
storm, the customary calm.
Spent night in discussing
tempting themes of Local
Taxation in London, and
Superannuation of School-teachers.
On latter subject
that <i>preux Chevalier</i>, <span class="sc">Temple</span>, laying down the lute, and leaving
Amaryllis in the shade, delivered luminous speech; convinced
<span class="sc">Chancellor</span> of the <span class="sc">Exchequer</span>; made him promise to fork
out.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Much of useful kind.</p>

<hr />

<p>"<span class="sc">Suppositious</span>."&mdash;"Well," observed our old friend, who was discussing a recent
case that had been headed "Romance in the Court of Chancery," "this all comes from
bringing up a child that they pretended was their own. I mean what they call 'A
Superstitious Child.'"</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="sc">Quite Another Thing</span>.&mdash;With reference to a recent burglary at Sir <span class="sc">Thomas
Pigot's</span>, it is stated that "thieves were known to be in the neighbourhood, and the
police have the matter in hand." Wouldn't it be better if they had the thieves
there?</p>
